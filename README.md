## Green and Farmers Markets NYC Project
### A comprehensive guide to all NYC greenmarkets and farmers markets

###### Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive product that hosts all the green markets and farmers markets in New York City. The project utilized multiple datasets, websites, and resources to gather information about these markets.

###### Data Sources

Posters and Websites: Utilized posters and various websites that listed information about green and farmers markets in NYC.

Open Data Dataset: Leveraged open data datasets specific to NYC farmers markets for additional information.

###### Methodology

Web Scraping: Python was used to scrape data from PDFs and websites to collect market information.

CSV Creation: The scraped data was then converted into CSV format for further processing.

Geocoding: Attempts were made to write a script to automatically find latitude and longitude coordinates for market addresses. However, due to limitations, manual geocoding was performed for multiple market locations.

Mapping: The CSV data, along with the NYC open dataset, was combined and uploaded into Arcgis Online, where a map was created and market locations were plotted.

Dashboard Creation: Lastly, an interactive web and mobile dashboard was developed to provide an easy-to-use interface for accessing market 
information using Arcgis tools.

###### Conclusion

The project culminated in the creation of a comprehensive platform that hosts information about green and farmers markets in NYC. The combination of various data sources, web scraping techniques, geocoding efforts, and mapping capabilities resulted in an interactive and user-friendly solution.
